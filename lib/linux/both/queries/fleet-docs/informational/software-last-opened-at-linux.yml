- name: Software last opened at (Linux)
  description: A software override query to append last_opened_at information to Linux
    DEB software entries. The accuracy of this information is limited by the accuracy
    of the atime column in the file table, which can be affected by the system clock
    and mount settings like noatime and relatime.
  query: "SELECT\n    package,\n    MAX(atime) AS last_opened_at\nFROM deb_package_files\n\
    CROSS JOIN file USING (path)\nWHERE type = 'regular'\n  AND regex_match(file.mode,\
    \ '[1357]', 0)\nGROUP BY package;\n"
  platform: linux
