- name: Detect active processes with Log4j running
  description: 'Returns a list of active processes and the Jar paths which are using
    Log4j. Version numbers are usually within the Jar filename. Note: This query is
    resource intensive and has caused problems on systems with limited swap space.
    Test on some systems before running this widely.'
